As such, it has the same monotone finish and comes with a single camera on the back. It ships in four color options: Blue, Purple, Starlight, and Space Grey. While the Apple iPad Air (2024) looks the same for the most part, it is available in two screen sizes for the first time.The screen sizes it is available on are 11 and 13 inches. The Apple iPad Air was available in the former size previously, however, we are getting the larger 13 inches as well for 2024. Either way, it is a Liquid Retina display (IPS LCD) with True Tone and antireflective coating. Additionally, the screen covers a wide P3 color gamut. In the meantime, the smaller of the two options peaks at 500 nits of brightness while the larger can push an extra 100 nits of brightness.PerformanceThe 2024 version of the Apple iPad Air once again packs an M-series chip for its performance. The American company shipped the iPad Air (2022) with M1 chips. Similarly, the latest variant is getting upgraded with the M2 chip which is built on a second-gen 5nm nodeFurthermore, the chip has eight CPU and 10 GPU cores respectively. Other than that, this tablet comes with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage while booting on iPad OS 17.4Camera and the restIn terms of optics, the Apple iPad Air (2024) comes with two cameras altogether, both of which are 12-megapixel each. The front camera here is an ultrawide unit aligned horizontally with support for the “Center Stage” feature. Meanwhile, the rear shooter is a wide camera with 4K video recording capabilities."
