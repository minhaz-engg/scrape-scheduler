It was released on 2024, September 26. Xiaomi Redmi Note 14 has 6.67 inch, OLED, 120Hz, HDR10+, 2100 nits (peak), a resolution of 1080 x 2400 pixels screen with Corning Gorilla Glass 5. Xiaomi Redmi Note 14 uses Mediatek Dimensity 7025 Ultra (6 nm) chipset, Octa-core (2×2.5 GHz Cortex-A78 & 6×2.0 GHz Cortex-A55) CPU, IMG BXM-8-256 GPU. It supports 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G networks with Dual SIM (Nano-SIM, dual stand-by). It has 5MP Dual main camera, 16MP Single selfie camera. Xiaomi Redmi Note 14 uses 5110 mAh, non-removable battery.Design and DisplayThe core design of both phones remains the same, however, the Redmi has given the Note 14 5G enough tweaks to be visually distinguishable. The camera cutout has grown larger, while the back panel has gone back to being curved. Similarly, the camera island has gone a bit softer with the edge, and the LED flash has shifted a couple of millimetres. The phone offers an added level of durability with an IP64 rating, reinforced internal design, and a Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection.On the front, it has a 6.67-inch OLED screen with FHD+ resolution. It offers a refresh rate of up to 120Hz and a peak brightness of 2,100 nits. You also get a standard and instantaneous touch sampling rate of 240Hz and 2,160Hz respectively. The display is capable of HDR10+ and covers the DCI-P3 colour gamut. Moreover, it has received TÜV and SGS certifications for eye care features like low blue light.Network:The phone has supported 2G, 3G, 4G, and 5G Network facilities. Moreover, GPRS and EDGE facilities also have. HSPA 42.2/5.76 Mbps, LTE-A, 5G speed on the phone.PerformanceThe MediaTek Dimensity 7025 Ultra serves as the brain of the Redmi Note 14 5G. With 6nm fabrication and a higher 2.5GHz clock speed, this chipset offers a decent upgrade over the Dimensity 6080 on its predecessor. Furthermore, the phone is available in four configurations: 6GB + 128GB, 8GB + 128GB, 8GB + 256GB, and 12GB + 256GB. For battery, it has a sizable 5,110 mAh cell with 45W charging support.Camera and the restThe primary shooter on the Redmi Note 14 5G is a 50MP OIS-enabled lens coupled with a Sony LYT-600 sensor. While the resolution on the newer phone drops by half compared to its predecessor, the higher-quality Sony sensor should make up for any possible compromise. Additionally, there is a 2MP auxiliary lens helping out with depth detection and bokeh effect. It barely adds to the photography experience though. Meanwhile, a 16MP camera sits on the front for selfies and face scanning.Connectivity-wise, you get dual-SIM support with 5G cellular, dual-band WiFi 5, and Bluetooth v5.3 for wireless medium. On the other hand, a USB Type-C port and a 3.5mm headphone jack handle the wired connections. For additional security, there is an in-display fingerprint sensor. The company also mentions “Heart rate detection” as a feature on this phone, but refuses to elaborate any further.

Xiaomi Redmi Note 14 uses 5110 mAh, non-removable battery.Design and DisplayThe core design of both phones remains the same, however, the Redmi has given the Note 14 5G enough tweaks to be visually distinguishable. The camera cutout has grown larger, while the back panel has gone back to being curved. Similarly, the camera island has gone a bit softer with the edge, and the LED flash has shifted a couple of millimetres. The phone offers an added level of durability with an IP64 rating, reinforced internal design, and a Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection.On the front, it has a 6.67-inch OLED screen with FHD+ resolution.

Additionally, there is a 2MP auxiliary lens helping out with depth detection and bokeh effect. It barely adds to the photography experience though. Meanwhile, a 16MP camera sits on the front for selfies and face scanning.Connectivity-wise, you get dual-SIM support with 5G cellular, dual-band WiFi 5, and Bluetooth v5.3 for wireless medium. On the other hand, a USB Type-C port and a 3.5mm headphone jack handle the wired connections. For additional security, there is an in-display fingerprint sensor.

It was released on 2024, September 26. Redmi Note 14 Pro has 6.67 inch, AMOLED, 68B colors, 120Hz, HDR10+, Dolby Vision, 3000 nits (peak), a resolution of 1220 x 2712 pixels screen with Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2. Note 14 Pro uses Mediatek Dimensity 7300 Ultra (4 nm) chipset, Octa-core (4×2.5 GHz Cortex-A78 & 4×2.0 GHz Cortex-A55) CPU, Mali-G615 MC2 GPU. It supports 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G networks with Nano-SIM, eSIM or Dual SIM (Nano-SIM, dual stand-by). Redmi Note 14 Pro has 5MP Triple main camera, 2MP Single selfie camera. It uses 5500 mAh, non-removable battery.Design and DisplayRight from the get-go, it is pretty clear that Redmi Note 14 Pro is trying to emulate what the higher-end Note offering did last year. Among the available designs, a single purple colour option sticks out the most with a vegan leather finish — similar to the Note 13 Pro+! Additionally, the phone comes with IP68 water and dust resistance — pretty reminiscent of you know which phone. It also dons a Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front adding to its toughness. The overall design has been overhauled with a reshaped and relocated camera island.We are getting a 6.67-inch 12-bit OLED screen with 1.5K resolution on this phone. Moreover, it is capable of up to 120Hz refresh rate, 3,000 nits peak brightness, and 480Hz touch sampling rate. In the meantime, the instantaneous touch sampling rate on the Redmi Note 14 Pro is much higher at 2,560Hz. Not only that, it also offers wet hands touch support, 1,920Hz PWM dimming, DCI-P3 colour gamut, HDR10+ and has a triple certification from TÜV Rheinland for eye protection features.PerformanceAlong with the aesthetic, the Redmi Note 14 Pro gets an upgrade on the performance side of things as well. Firstly, the new phone houses the MediaTek Dimensity 7300 Ultra, which is decently better than the Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 on its predecessor. It is also available in wider configurations, those being: 8GB + 128GB, 8GB + 256GB, 12GB + 256GB, and 12GB + 512GB. Likewise, the battery has beefed up to 5,500 mAh compared to 5,100 mAh last year. However, the charging speed has dropped to 45W from 67W, which is still plenty fast.Camera and the restThe camera department gets some adjustments too. Instead of going for a big 200MP sensor, Xiaomi has kept it simple with a 50MP shooter. The sensor size has shrunken too, with a 1/1.96-inch unit this time, while previously there was a much larger 1/1.4-inch sensor. It is a LYT-600 sensor from Sony though, which is also present on the Redmi Note 14 5G. While the camera appears to be a downgrade on paper, we can only tell for certain once we test it hands-on. Other than that, the auxiliary lenses remain unchanged with an 8MP ultrawide and a 2MP macro shooter. Meanwhile, the selfie snapper is now a 20MP unit instead of the 16MP on the previous iteration.The Redmi Note 14 Pro supports dual SIM 5G cellular and dual-band WiFi 6 connectivity. Furthermore, you get Bluetooth v5.4 alongside high-quality codecs like LDAC and LHDC-V. There is also NFC, five-way navigation support and IR blaster as additional wireless connectivity options. Other than that, there is a stereo speaker setup and an X-axis linear motor to enhance the gaming and multimedia experience.",

It was released on 2024, September 26. Redmi Note 14 Pro has 6.67 inch, AMOLED, 68B colors, 120Hz, HDR10+, Dolby Vision, 3000 nits (peak), a resolution of 1220 x 2712 pixels screen with Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2. Note 14 Pro uses Mediatek Dimensity 7300 Ultra (4 nm) chipset, Octa-core (4×2.5 GHz Cortex-A78 & 4×2.0 GHz Cortex-A55) CPU, Mali-G615 MC2 GPU. It supports 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G networks with Nano-SIM, eSIM or Dual SIM (Nano-SIM, dual stand-by). Redmi Note 14 Pro has 5MP Triple main camera, 2MP Single selfie camera. It uses 5500 mAh, non-removable battery.Design and DisplayRight from the get-go, it is pretty clear that Redmi Note 14 Pro is trying to emulate what the higher-end Note offering did last year. Among the available designs, a single purple colour option sticks out the most with a vegan leather finish — similar to the Note 13 Pro+! Additionally, the phone comes with IP68 water and dust resistance — pretty reminiscent of you know which phone. It also dons a Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front adding to its toughness. The overall design has been overhauled with a reshaped and relocated camera island.We are getting a 6.67-inch 12-bit OLED screen with 1.5K resolution on this phone. Moreover, it is capable of up to 120Hz refresh rate, 3,000 nits peak brightness, and 480Hz touch sampling rate. In the meantime, the instantaneous touch sampling rate on the Redmi Note 14 Pro is much higher at 2,560Hz. Not only that, it also offers wet hands touch support, 1,920Hz PWM dimming, DCI-P3 colour gamut, HDR10+ and has a triple certification from TÜV Rheinland for eye protection features.PerformanceAlong with the aesthetic, the Redmi Note 14 Pro gets an upgrade on the performance side of things as well. Firstly, the new phone houses the MediaTek Dimensity 7300 Ultra, which is decently better than the Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 on its predecessor. It is also available in wider configurations, those being: 8GB + 128GB, 8GB + 256GB, 12GB + 256GB, and 12GB + 512GB. Likewise, the battery has beefed up to 5,500 mAh compared to 5,100 mAh last year. However, the charging speed has dropped to 45W from 67W, which is still plenty fast.Camera and the restThe camera department gets some adjustments too. Instead of going for a big 200MP sensor, Xiaomi has kept it simple with a 50MP shooter. The sensor size has shrunken too, with a 1/1.96-inch unit this time, while previously there was a much larger 1/1.4-inch sensor. It is a LYT-600 sensor from Sony though, which is also present on the Redmi Note 14 5G. While the camera appears to be a downgrade on paper, we can only tell for certain once we test it hands-on. Other than that, the auxiliary lenses remain unchanged with an 8MP ultrawide and a 2MP macro shooter. Meanwhile, the selfie snapper is now a 20MP unit instead of the 16MP on the previous iteration.The Redmi Note 14 Pro supports dual SIM 5G cellular and dual-band WiFi 6 connectivity. Furthermore, you get Bluetooth v5.4 alongside high-quality codecs like LDAC and LHDC-V. There is also NFC, five-way navigation support and IR blaster as additional wireless connectivity options. Other than that, there is a stereo speaker setup and an X-axis linear motor to enhance the gaming and multimedia experience."
